A method is a block of code that does some actions.
You can use it again and again , instead of writing the same code many times.

Parameter:
A parameter is like an empty box you give to the method. The method will use whatever value you senf into that box.
Example Code:
void greet(String name){
  System.out.println("Hello "+name);
}
here, [String name] is the parameter. It tells the method: I need a name to say hello. From the main method you have to 
invoke the greet() method with a name like:

  greet("Lira");

here "Lira" is the argument and you are passing agrument into the parameter. 

Argument:
So, argument is the value that you give while calling the method.

Output will be Hello Lira.
