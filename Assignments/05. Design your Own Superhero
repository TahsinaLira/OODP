* Design a class Superhero 
       ~ Attributes → name, powerLevel, ability

* Use constructor to set the data

* Overload method usePower():
       ~ One with no parameters → Prints a message (A is using x ability)
       ~ One with a parameter String enemy → prints a message (who attack on enemy with which ability)

* Create a subclass (Child Class) FlyingHero that overrides usePower() that says this hero flies and
then uses the ability
