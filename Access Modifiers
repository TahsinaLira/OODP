Access Modifiers in java are keywords that control who can see or use your variables, methods, classes.
They are like doors with different locks where you decide to how open or private your code should be.

We need Access Modifiers to protect important data, hide things that should not be used directly.
There are 4 types of Access Modifiers:
1. Public: Can be accessed from anywhere in the code
2. private: Only inside the same class
3. protected: same package and child classes
4. default (No keyword): same package only
