Class is a blueprint or a template of an object where the object uses that template to tell how it looks (configuration) and what it can do.
variables/ attributes are those things that you use to describe the information of an object
what an object can do, (the actions) are called methods
So an object is something that has variables(state) and methodes(Behaviors)

Example:
Lets say, there is a Phone. All the phones have: brand, color, Ram size, Battery level etc. And they can do things like making calls, taking pictures, sending messages....
so if we want to describe a phone in java, we can create a class like:


class Phone{
  String brand,color;
  int RAM, Battery;
  void call(){
  System.out.println("Calling...");
  }
  void takePictures(){
  System.out.println("Taking Pictures...");
  }
  void display(){
  System.out.println("Brand"+brand);
  System.out.println("color"+color);
  System.out.println("RAM:"+RAM);
  System.out.println("Battery Level:"+Battery);
}
}


Here we create the template for phone, it doesn't mean it beacome a real phone. Its just a blueprint. If we want to make it real we have to create an object that will 
configure all the elements of Phone class. Thus, a class is a logical construct. An object has physical reality.

public class Main{
       public static void main(String[] args){
Phone obj1=new Phone();  //this means new Phone() creates the new object of phone class which name is obj1 and points to that object
  obj1.brand="Iphone";
  obj1.color="Purple"
  obj1.RAM=216;
  obj1.Battery=80;

  obj1.call();
  obj1.takePictures();
}}


Objects are characterized by three essential properties: state, identity, and behavior.
1.The state of an object is a value from its data type. 
2.The identity of an object distinguishes one object from another. Which means one object is unique from another. It is useful to think of an objectâ€™s identity 
as the place where its value is stored in memory. Because every memory address is different for each object.
3.The behavior is the effect or result you get when you apply operations on the data - like calling methods or performing calculations.


if we recap the whole thing in simple, 
* A class is like a plan 
* An object is the real thing made from that plan
* A class has 
              Variables ~ to hold the informations(like brand, color)
              Methods   ~ to do things(Like call, take photo)
